This repository contains my solutions to the challenges from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Every day in December, a new programming challenge is released.

  - **/day1**: Challenge for day 1.
    - `Day1_1.java`: Solution for part 1 of day 1's challenge.
    - `Day1_2.java`: Solution for part 2 of day 1's challenge.
    - `DAy1.txt`: File with input data for day 1.
  - **/day2**: Challenge for day 2.
    - `...` (similar structure to day 1).

Each folder contains the daily challenges and input files provided by Advent of Code.
